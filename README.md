Below is a list of potential language models we can offer/serve as open and sustainable alternatives to commercially available services.

## Usable Language Models

There are 3 foundational models, **Llama 2**, **Mistral**, and **Mixtral** that we can offer.

## Llama 2
Llama 2 is an umbrella term for a family of LLMs, in particular any combination of:
- **Parameters**: 7B parameters, 13B, 34B, and 70B.
- **Fine tuning data set**: programming, chatting, or following instructions.

## Mistral
Separately, there is **Mistral**, a smaller 7B model, but with extensive training data. It is fast and performs better than the corresponding Llama 2, 7B parameter models in many tasks.

## Mixtral
The large alternative to Mistral is **Mixtral**, with a different architecture totaling 8\*7B=56B. Each inference step only uses 7B parameters, which makes inference fast, yet more powerful.

None of the models perform as well as **GPT-4**, some of them are comparable to **GPT-3.5**.

**Note**: *Mixtral and Llama 70B are very large models that need expensive GPUs.*
